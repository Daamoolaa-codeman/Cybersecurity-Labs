# Cybersecurity-Labs
## Overview
This lab demonstrates practical cybersecurity skills involving attack simulation, detection, analysis, and remediation using industry-standard security tools.

## Objectives
- Understand the security concept being tested
- Perform hands-on security configuration and testing
- Analyze attack behavior and system vulnerabilities
- Document mitigation and remediation strategies

## Lab Environment
- Virtualization Platform: VirtualBox
- Attacker Machine: Kali Linux
- Target Machine: [Ubuntu / DVWA / Honeypot / etc.]
- Network Configuration: Internal Network / NAT

## Tools Used
- Nmap
- Wireshark
- Cowrie Honeypot
- OpenVAS / Greenbone
- Metasploit Framework
- [Add any additional tools used]

## Activities Performed
1. Set up the lab virtual machines
2. Configured vulnerable/defensive services
3. Conducted scanning and reconnaissance
4. Captured and analyzed network traffic
5. Simulated exploitation (where applicable)
6. Developed remediation recommendations

## Key Findings
- [Example: Multiple open ports detected]
- [Example: Vulnerable service identified]
- [Example: Successful exploitation achieved]
- [Example: Suspicious login attempts recorded]

## Mitigation / Remediation
- Apply system patches and updates
- Enforce strong authentication controls
- Restrict unnecessary open ports
- Deploy monitoring and intrusion detection solutions

## Evidence
The following files are included in this repository:
- Scan results
- Packet capture files (.pcap)
- Screenshots of lab activities
- Vulnerability assessment reports
- Incident / remediation documentation
